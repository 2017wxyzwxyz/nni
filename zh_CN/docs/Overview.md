# NNI 概述

NNI (Neural Network Intelligence) 是自动机器学习（AutoML）实验的工具包。 每次实验，用户只需要定义搜索空间，改动几行代码，就能利用 NNI 内置的算法和训练服务来搜索最好的超参组合以及神经网络结构。

> 第一步：[定义搜索空间](SearchSpaceSpec.md)
> 
> 第二步：[改动模型代码](howto_1_WriteTrial.md)
> 
> 第三步：[定义实验配置](ExperimentConfig.md)

After user submits the experiment through a command line tool [nnictl](../tools/README.md), a demon process (NNI manager) take care of search process. NNI manager continuously get search settings that generated by tuning algorithms, then NNI manager asks the training service component to dispatch and run trial jobs in a targeted training environment (e.g. local machine, remote servers and cloud). The results of trials jobs such as model accurate will send back to tuning algorithms for generating more meaningful search settings. NNI manager stops the search process after it find the best models.

## Architecture Overview

User can use the nnictl and/or a visualized Web UI nniboard to monitor and debug a given experiment.

NNI provides a set of examples in the package to get you familiar with the above process. In the following example [/examples/trials/mnist], we had already set up the configuration and updated the training codes for you. You can directly run the following command to start an experiment.

## Key Concepts

**Experiment** in NNI is a method for testing different assumptions (hypotheses) by Trials under conditions constructed and controlled by NNI. During the experiment, one or more conditions are allowed to change in an organized manner and effects of these changes on associated conditions.

### **Trial**

**Trial** in NNI is an individual attempt at applying a set of parameters on a model.

### **Tuner**

**Tuner** in NNI is an implementation of Tuner API for a special tuning algorithm. [Read more about the Tuners supported in the latest NNI release](HowToChooseTuner.md)

### **Assessor**

**Assessor** in NNI is an implementation of Assessor API for optimizing the execution of experiment.
